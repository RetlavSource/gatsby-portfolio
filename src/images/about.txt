I am a student of Software Engineering at Fernando Pessoa University in Portugal, at the last year of the degree course, missing only one subject to complete.
Since only misses a subject to complete the degree, i am currently studying as an external student, in a master degree of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing at the same University.

I like to learn new programming languages, and self learning is a path that completes my learning technics. I am always excited for new projects and experiences ...

Nothing is impossible if it is possible to be done ... ... if I do not know, I will study and do it!
